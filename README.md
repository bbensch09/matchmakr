This repo exists to hold the core code for my passion project / MVP attempt at a product I'm calling MatchMakr. The project was begun on January 14th, 2015. While the code itself will remain open-source, all responsibility for the code and any resulting users/impact belong to Rent Masters, LLC, a registered corporation in the state of California.

Questions? please contact Brian at matchmakr.sf@gmail.com
